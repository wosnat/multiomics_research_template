# Research notebook

## Step protocol and enforcement

For per-milestone commit timing, hard gates, and the decide-gate checklist, see [Step protocol](step-protocol.md). This document owns the notebook **format and content**; step-protocol owns **when things happen and what gates enforce them**.

---

Every analysis is a **Plan phase** that converges on `proposal.md`, then a **Run phase** driven by **per-milestone interactive notebooks** — one `notebook.md` per Run milestone folder — plus a single `paper.md` at the analysis root that grows as a polished write-up. Execution is delegated to a coding subagent; quality control, exploration, and decision-making are always interactive and stay in the main thread (see [Code lifecycle](#code-lifecycle-analysis-first-productize-later)).

## Just-in-time formalization

Plans, framings, predictions, metrics, terms, decisions, and caveats enter the analysis **only when the data demands them**. Nothing is enumerated in advance "just in case." Its partner is **enumeration**: within what the plan *does* commit to, be concrete — a vague-but-approved plan is what forces redos.

Look at the data before drafting the plan. Pull what's in the KG — counts, fields, coverage — then propose the minimal framing that fits, stated concretely. Start simple; expand only when a specific finding forces it.

Concrete rules:
- **The Plan phase grounds the dialogue in MCP queries, not assumptions.** Before locking scope or framing, run `list_publications`, `list_experiments`, `list_organisms` filtered to the prompt's context. Surface counts and structural surprises (e.g. "axenic RNA-seq is single-contrast, not time-course") in the dialogue. Capture the queries and key counts in `proposal_notebook.md`.
- **The Plan phase locks the question and framing, not sub-questions.** Sub-narratives that form during dialogue (e.g., "protein persists while mRNA is gone") are for the Run phase to test. Defer; note them.
- **Framing has a floor, not a template.** The floor — all five, stated concretely: hypothesis in prose; approach (how and why); a deliberate statistics decision (the specific test and thresholds, *or* an explicit reasoned "none, because descriptive"); a named validation set (genes/pathways whose behavior is already known, with the expected behavior if the method works); a falsifiability check (the result that would say the method found nothing real, and a pre-registered expected-negative class that should *not* score if the signal is genuine). Nothing beyond the floor unless the data forces it.
- **Predictions are named, not matrixed.** If confirmation bias is a real risk, name 1–3 predictions — not a 4×4 matrix of ordering and thresholds.
- **Stability checks are added when a specific result triggers them**, not planned up front.
- **Decisions are written when forced by data**, not anticipated. No "we may decide X" placeholders.
- **The methods milestone stays minimal** — ad-hoc Python module implementing exactly the approach the proposal committed to.
- **Caveats are harvested at the evaluation milestone** from what actually happened; not pre-cataloged.

This principle governs the whole arc. If you find yourself listing or architecting things the analysis might need before the data has arrived, stop.

## The arc

**Plan phase** — one grounded `superpowers:brainstorming` conversation converging on `proposal.md`:
1. **Question** — the locked research question
2. **KG entries** — relevant publications, experiments, organisms, data types, enumerated from the KG
3. **Framing** — hypothesis, approach, statistics plan, validation set, falsifiability check / expected-negative, all in KG terms (the enumerated floor above)

`proposal.md` is the **research proposal**, locked at the end of the Plan phase. The Run phase executes against it.

**Run phase** — three milestones, each in its own folder:
- **methods** — implement the approach the proposal committed to as an ad-hoc Python module; toy-test it
- **analysis** — run the method; produce scored outputs, figures, tables
- **evaluation** — assess results against the framing; harvest caveats; finalize the paper

The Plan phase produces `proposal.md` + `proposal_notebook.md` (grounding queries, counts, rejected alternatives). It is interactive, not scripted, but not assumption-driven — MCP queries ground the conversation. Run milestones add `scripts/`, `data/`, `figures/`, and QC alongside `notebook.md`.

## The Run-milestone rhythm: co-define → do → show → explore → decide

Every Run milestone advances through these phases (see [step-protocol.md](step-protocol.md) for commit timing, gates, and delegation):

- **co-define** — before doing the work, propose the milestone to the researcher in plain language (what it should produce, the judgment calls, why) and let them shape it; begin only once you've agreed
- **do** — the coding subagent does the agreed work; outputs land wherever they naturally belong
- **show** — the main thread populates `notebook.md` from the subagent's returned artifacts and run-manifest
- **explore** — investigate anomalies, surprises, or gaps; each question is a fresh subagent invocation returning the artifact that answers it; the main thread interprets
- **decide** — finalize notebook, update paper.md, run critical review (analysis + evaluation; methods when it emits a data artifact; a delta pass if claims grew after the first pass), present state to researcher, commit on approval

## notebook.md format

One `notebook.md` per Run-milestone folder. Freeform prose, not a rigid template — include what applies to the milestone. **The main thread owns and writes `notebook.md`** — it pastes the coding subagent's factual run-manifest verbatim into the mechanical sections (What I did, raw Results tables) and writes every interpretive section itself. The subagent never writes conclusions into the notebook (see [Code lifecycle](#code-lifecycle-analysis-first-productize-later)).

### Recommended sections

- **Context** — what this milestone is for; what the proposal or prior milestone set up
- **What I did** — work performed; scripts run with their command-line invocation for non-trivial cases; KG queries issued
- **Results** — summary tables shown inline (as markdown tables, not prose paraphrases); links to full tables in `data/` and figures in `figures/` produced this milestone; cited publications from the KG by DOI or experiment ID — resolved via `list_publications`, never from memory (see [anti-hallucination.md — Category 5](anti-hallucination.md#category-5-source-of-truth-verification-failures))
- **Surprises** — anomalies, data oddities, unexpected distributions worth flagging
- **Decisions** — in prose with dates, if any forks were taken this milestone; omit if none
- **Advance rationale** — one line at the end

### Decide-gate checklist (end of notebook.md)

At milestone close, the notebook ends with this checklist (see [step-protocol.md](step-protocol.md) for the approval gate):

- **Outputs produced** — filenames in `scripts/`, `data/`, `figures/`, with command lines for non-trivial scripts (for reproducibility)
- **Results presented** — summary tables shown inline in `notebook.md`; links to full tables and figures generated this milestone
- **QC gate** — what was checked → result (one line per check)
- **Decisions made this milestone** — prose + date, if any; omit the section if none
- **Advance rationale** — one line, why this milestone is ready to close

The checklist must stay this minimal. It is not a template to extend with optional fields. Inflation of this list reintroduces the premature-formalization failure that the per-milestone notebook is designed to prevent.

### Labels

Labels are permitted within a single document when each label is paired with a short readable name in the same paragraph on first mention. **No cross-file labels.**

- OK: "the coculture-stronger prediction (2) was not supported; (2) rests on the assumption that axenic cells shut down before fully engaging response"
- Not OK: "P2 failed" (no name) or "see D7 in decisions.md" (cross-file label)

If paired-label-plus-name still obscures content, drop to prose-only — labels are a convenience, not a requirement.

### Overwrite vs append

A milestone's `notebook.md` represents what-we-now-believe-happened in that milestone. On redo, the notebook is **overwritten**, not appended — the narrative reflects the successful attempt, not a log of past attempts. The prior attempt lives in git history (see [step-protocol.md — Redo path](step-protocol.md)).

`gaps_and_friction.md` is **append-only** (see below).

## paper.md growth pattern

Single `paper.md` at the analysis root. Skeleton sections exist from day 1 (seeded by Claude during scaffolding at the start of the Plan phase) and fill in as the analysis advances — during the Plan commit and each Run milestone's **decide** phase, after the notebook is finalized but before the commit.

| paper.md section | Populated from |
|---|---|
| Question | Plan phase (proposal) |
| Background | Plan phase (KG entries and prior work) |
| Methods | Plan phase (framing) + methods milestone (implementation) |
| Results | analysis milestone |
| Discussion | evaluation milestone |
| References | accumulates across every phase that cites publications |

References are populated as publications are cited. Every reference must be resolved through `list_publications` and cited by DOI or KG experiment ID — never drafted from intrinsic knowledge (see [anti-hallucination.md — Category 5.2](anti-hallucination.md#52-publication-attribution-from-training-knowledge)). Citation format inside prose can be short (author-year or numeric); the References section at the end carries the resolved DOI or experiment ID for each.

When the analysis ends, the paper ends. A recurring failure mode was deferring write-up to a final step that never happened — `paper.md`'s incremental growth prevents this.

## gaps_and_friction.md (transitional)

A top-level file at `analyses/<slug>/gaps_and_friction.md` captures friction encountered during the analysis, distinct from decisions:

- **Decision** = a fork the analysis had to take, based on data → logged in the relevant milestone's `notebook.md` (or `proposal.md` if the fork was in the Plan phase)
- **Friction** = a problem that slowed us down, surprised us, or revealed a gap in methodology / KG / tooling → logged in `gaps_and_friction.md`

These can co-occur — a methodology gap can force both a decision and a friction entry. Log in both places when that happens.

**What goes in `gaps_and_friction.md`:**
- KG data issues and bugs encountered
- MCP tool schema or capability mismatches (see [anti-hallucination.md — Category 5.1](anti-hallucination.md#51-mcp-tool-capability-from-memory))
- Methodology gaps discovered during execution (nuances the framing didn't anticipate)
- Anti-hallucination corrections (claims from memory caught by verification)
- Process friction (things that slowed the work)

Each entry is prose with a date, a short name, what happened, and — if relevant — the workaround and the downstream impact on methodology/KG/tooling.

**Write the entry when it happens, not at the end.** The log decays late in a run, when the milestones are heaviest and the lessons most expensive. Two recurring leaks to watch: a `notebook.md` that points at an entry never written, and a **critic finding that exposed a gap the framing didn't anticipate** — that is friction (what the *next* analysis needs to know), not only a disposition (what you fixed in *this* one). The decide gate checks both — see [step-protocol.md — "decide" phase](step-protocol.md).

**Why this is transitional.** The methodology itself is under development. Every analysis teaches us something about what's missing or awkward. `gaps_and_friction.md` is the learning record that feeds back into methodology and KG/tooling improvements. Mandatory while the methodology is being stabilized — likely the first 3–5 analyses. Once the pattern settles, revisit: keep, make optional, or fold into `notebook.md`. Retirement criterion: when two consecutive analyses produce a near-empty `gaps_and_friction.md` (only incidental friction, no methodology gaps), propose retiring the requirement.

Append-only. Redo friction entries accumulate.

## Using `superpowers:brainstorming` for the Plan phase

The brainstorming skill's dialogue pattern (clarifying questions one at a time, proposing approaches, converging, then presenting a design for approval) fits the whole Plan phase — the phase *is* one brainstorming conversation that lands the question, the KG entries, and the enumerated framing. **Three overrides apply:**

1. **Capture location.** The skill's default writes a design doc to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`. Override: the design doc is `analyses/<slug>/proposal.md` (question + KG entries + enumerated framing), and the dialogue record — clarifying exchange in summary form, KG-grounding queries and counts, rejected alternatives — lands in `analyses/<slug>/proposal_notebook.md`.
2. **KG grounding alongside the dialogue.** Brainstorming is pure conversation by default. The Plan phase adds MCP grounding (`list_publications`, `list_experiments`, `list_organisms` filtered to the prompt's context) before scope or framing decisions. Capture queries and counts in `proposal_notebook.md`. See the Just-in-time concrete rules above for the rationale.
3. **Terminal action.** The skill's terminal state is invoking `superpowers:writing-plans`. **Skip this.** The Plan phase's approval advances to the Run phase (methods milestone), not to implementation-plan writing. `proposal.md` *is* the plan — the enumerated framing replaces a separate implementation plan.

Brainstorming's own **spec self-review** and **user-reviews-the-spec** steps are kept — they become the Plan phase's close gate, plus one addition: the fresh-context critic runs on every proposal (interpretation-only) before the researcher approves. See [step-protocol.md — The Plan phase](step-protocol.md) for the ordered close (self-review → critic → researcher approval → commit → Run begins).

If the skill's preamble nudges toward writing a spec doc outside the analysis folder or invoking writing-plans at the end, treat those as defaults being overridden by this methodology skill (which has higher priority for research work in this repo).

## QC checkpoint types

What to show depends on the phase.

### KG entries + framing (Plan phase)
- Row counts per filter: experiments at each stage (started with → filter by organism → filter by assay → final)
- Sample rows of selected entries (experiment ID, publication, TPs, omics)
- Per-TP gene counts (`timepoints[].gene_count`) or the distinct-gene denominator (`distinct_gene_count`), **not** cumulative `gene_count` (see [anti-hallucination.md — Category 5.3](anti-hallucination.md#53-field-semantics-from-memory--cumulative-vs-per-timepoint-counts))
- Publication attributions resolved via `list_publications`
- Validation set selected from the KG with validation: what distinguishes an expected-positive from the expected-negative class; coverage of TPs/conditions; distributional QC
- Hypothesis in prose; statistics decision (named test or reasoned "none"); falsifiability check phrased in KG-operational terms (what table / metric / direction would show a hit, and what would show nothing real)

### Computation / metric (methods milestone)
- Worked example: 2–3 genes or clusters through the formula with actual numbers, step by step
- Summary statistics of the output (distribution, range, NaNs)
- Sanity check against the validation set ("glnA should score high — does it?")

### Scoring / comparison (analysis milestone)
- Full results table in markdown (the actual numbers, not prose summary)
- Best/worst scores, surprises, anything unexpected
- Cross-condition comparison with expectation check against the proposal's framing

### Evaluation (evaluation milestone)
- Named predictions held / not held
- Sensitivity / LOO stability where applicable
- Harvested caveats

## Code lifecycle: analysis-first, productize later

Research code has two phases. Follow phase 1 during analysis; flag phase 2 candidates.

### Who writes what

Execution is delegated to a **coding subagent** (`superpowers:subagent-driven-development`); judgment stays in the main thread. The division is by artifact type:

- **The coding subagent authors** scripts (and their docstrings), data files, figures, logs, and a factual **run-manifest** (which scripts ran, command lines, KG queries, row counts, candidate anomalies). It executes and reports facts; it does not conclude.
- **The main thread authors** `notebook.md`, `paper.md`, `gaps_and_friction.md`, critical-review dispositions, and the decide-gate checklist — pasting the run-manifest verbatim into the mechanical notebook sections and writing every interpretive section itself.

Two rules keep delegation from breaking the skill's guarantees: the subagent loads `research-methodology` (or at least the KG / gene-identity / python-api / anti-hallucination references) so it doesn't re-hallucinate gene identities or miscount fields; and the *same* subagent stays alive across a milestone's invocations so those rules and the analysis context persist. Where no subagents are available, the same work runs inline — same rules, same artifacts, same ownership. See [SKILL.md Rule 8 — Run](../SKILL.md).

### Phase 1 — Analysis code (methodology-first)

Code lives in the analysis directory. Goal: correct methodology, not good software engineering.

**Separate reusable logic from scripts.** When the methods milestone introduces a new method, put the reusable logic in a utility module within the milestone folder (`methods/<module_name>.py`) and let scripts in later milestones import it. Scripts call utilities for specific data; utilities contain the methodology. This separation is what makes toy-testing possible and productization straightforward later.

**Methods modules describe methodology, not implementation scaffolding.** For novel utilities (scoring functions, metrics, gene-set operations), the module should be minimal — the formula with a worked example, expected I/O, and the minimum code to compute it. Regular extraction/plotting scripts are straightforward enough not to need a separate utility.

**Toy-data verification before real data** (`superpowers:test-driven-development`). When building a reusable utility, verify with hand-calculated toy examples first. Create small synthetic input, compute expected output by hand, run the utility, compare, log the verification in `methods/notebook.md`. Applies to anything in a shared utility; one-off scripts don't need it.

**A green suite is not evidence the code is correct on real input.** Two rules close the gap:

- **Fixtures use the real artifact's serialization form.** Build the toy input the way the data actually arrives — if the pipeline reads a CSV, the fixture's fields are the *strings* a CSV yields, not the Python objects you had in mind. A fixture whose input *type* differs from the real data hides every bug in the parsing layer while reporting all-green.
- **The main thread spot-runs the utility on one real row** before the milestone closes, and logs the result as a QC-gate line. Re-deriving one real case by hand is what catches what the suite structurally cannot.

*Why (Alteromonas coculture, 2026-07-23):* a reference-class assigner used `bool(row["in_candidate"])`; the real CSV stores that field as the string `"False"`, and `bool("False")` is truthy — on real data every system would have collapsed into one class, destroying the control structure the whole null comparison rested on. All 27 tests passed, because the fixture used Python booleans. A spot-run on one real CSV row caught it.

**Refine through the notebook QC cycle.** The co-define → do → show → explore → decide loop is how methodology gets validated. Formula corrections, edge cases, direction logic — all discovered through the researcher walking through concrete examples.

### Phase 2 — Productization (software-first)

After the analysis, if a utility proves reusable (used across multiple analyses), flag it for productization — a separate brainstorm with API design, tests, and documentation. It moves from the analysis directory to a shared package (e.g., `multiomics_explorer/analysis/`).

Don't productize speculatively. Wait for proven reuse — the analysis notebooks across multiple analyses are the evidence.
