description: Use before the researcher sees a claim-bearing artifact of a research analysis — the proposal at the close of the Plan phase, the analysis and evaluation milestones at their decide phase, the methods milestone when it emits a data artifact, and any milestone whose claims expanded after its earlier pass — plus on demand at any point. Dispatches a fresh-context critic that re-checks the artifact's own claims against its own files. The proposal gets interpretation only; the analysis and data-emitting methods milestones get data-integrity + interpretation; the evaluation milestone gets interpretation only. The critic reviews only that artifact's files; earlier phases are trusted inputs, not re-audited.

# Critical review

Dispatch a fresh-context critic to challenge a research milestone **before** it is
presented at the decide gate. The critic never sees your session history — it
reads the milestone's artifacts cold, so it cannot inherit the narrative you
anchored on while doing the work. That detachment is the point: the failure modes
the methodology keeps hitting (a heatmap narrated "all 5 are UP" when the data
file says otherwise; a difference-of-trajectories narrated as "coculture vs
axenic" when each arm is starvation-vs-its-own-baseline) survive precisely because
the author is committed to the story. A reviewer reading only the data files is
not.

This does not replace the researcher's decide-gate approval — it sharpens it.
The critic's findings, where any exist, become part of the state you present.

## Keep it light — three rules that bound the cost

1. **Match the lens to what the milestone produces.** Don't run every dimension on
   every milestone.
2. **Review only this milestone's own files.** The proposal and earlier milestones
   already passed their own review — treat their outputs as trusted inputs, not as
   things to re-audit.
3. **Write an artifact only when there are findings.** A clean milestone gets one
   line in `notebook.md`, not a file.

## When it runs, and with which lens

**Proposal (automatic; interpretation only).** The proposal is the
highest-leverage artifact — a flaw in the framing propagates through all three
Run milestones and is the most expensive to unwind — so it is reviewed before the
Run phase begins. Its lens is **interpretation only**: there is no data yet, so
there is nothing to integrity-check; the critic weighs the framing's testability,
controls, confounders, and whether the statistics decision, validation set, and
falsifiability check / expected-negative fit the question. Invoke it especially when the framing rests on a judgment call that
is not self-evidently sound: a **non-obvious combining key** (e.g. mapping
disjoint strains onto shared ortholog groups), a **derived or constructed
comparison**, or **controls whose validity is not obvious** (is the positive
control really independent? is the negative control the contrast it is labelled
as?). The proposal review sits alongside the author's own self-review and the
researcher's approval of `proposal.md` — see [step-protocol.md — The Plan phase](../research-methodology/references/step-protocol.md).

**Analysis milestone (automatic; the one heavy gate).** This is where computed
results first appear, so it gets the full pass: **data-integrity + interpretation**.
The data-integrity half is what pays off here — it opens the CSVs and checks the
signs, counts, truncation, and conflation that the narrative glosses.

**Methods milestone (automatic when it emits a data artifact; otherwise on
demand).** A methods milestone whose only output is a toy-tested function can
wait for the analysis pass. But when the method includes **constructing the
entity set** — a parts list, a curated candidate set, a classification table —
that file carries claims (substrate labels, confidence flags, class assignments)
and every downstream score inherits them. Then it gets the full
**data-integrity + interpretation** lens, on the same footing as the analysis
milestone. Do not skip it because the milestone is labelled "methods": the errors
this catches are exactly the ones no later pass will, because later milestones
read the parts list as a *trusted input*.

**Delta pass (expected, not exceptional).** A critic pass is point-in-time, and
the **explore** phase runs *after* it by construction — the researcher asks for
follow-on analyses, and new scripts, figures and conclusions land during decide.
**If a milestone's claims materially expand after its pass, re-run the critic
over the delta before closing.** Tell the re-dispatch which prior files are
already-reviewed (list them as trusted inputs) so it reviews only the new work,
not the whole milestone again. Treat a milestone that explored after its pass and
closed without a delta pass as having closed unreviewed work — the clean first
verdict does not cover what came after it.

**Evaluation milestone (automatic; light).** Evaluation produces conclusions, not
new computation, so a data-integrity sweep has little to bite. Run **interpretation
only**: is each conclusion earned by the analysis milestone's results? are caveats
honest? is anything over-claimed, causal-from-correlational, or compared across
platforms? Evaluation reads the analysis milestone's outputs as **trusted
evidence** — it judges whether the conclusions follow from them; it does not
re-open those files hunting for new data defects (the analysis review already did
that).

**Any point, on demand.** A methods milestone that emits no data but rests on a
non-obvious choice, or a redo you want re-checked, can be reviewed at will.

**Not run by a subagent:** routine **methodology compliance** (locus tags present,
computations in scripts, results tabled not paraphrased, decide-gate checklist
populated). These are mechanical self-checks — they belong in the author's
decide-gate checklist ([step-protocol.md](../research-methodology/references/step-protocol.md)),
not a fresh-context dispatch.

## How to dispatch

**1. Identify the folder under review and the analysis root** (e.g.
`analyses/<name>/analysis/` under `analyses/<name>/`; for a framing review, the
proposal files at the analysis root).

**2. Dispatch a `general-purpose` subagent**, filling the template at
[critical-reviewer.md](critical-reviewer.md).

Placeholders:
- `{ANALYSIS_ROOT}` — path to the analysis directory
- `{REVIEW_FOLDER}` — path to the folder under review (the **only** files in review
  scope); for a framing review, `proposal.md` at the analysis root
- `{REVIEW_NAME}` — what is under review (e.g. "the analysis milestone")
- `{REVIEW_INTENT}` — one or two plain-language sentences on what this milestone set
  out to do and the main judgment calls it made (the co-define agreement, or the
  proposal's framing)
- `{REVIEW_LENS}` — which dimensions to apply: `interpretation only` for the
  proposal and the evaluation milestone; `data-integrity + interpretation` for the
  analysis milestone and for a methods milestone that emitted a data artifact; for
  other on-demand runs, choose by what was produced (data files → include
  data-integrity; conclusions only → interpretation only)
- `{TRUSTED_INPUTS}` — prior output files this artifact builds on, which the critic
  reads as evidence but does **not** re-audit (e.g. the analysis milestone's data/
  for an evaluation review; the methods milestone's data artifact for an analysis
  review). Empty for the proposal, and for an analysis milestone whose methods
  milestone emitted no data file.

**3. Handle the result by what it found:**
- **Findings exist** → write the critic's findings verbatim to a
  `critical_review.md` in the review folder (for the proposal, whose files sit at
  the analysis root, use `proposal_critical_review.md`), each with your
  **disposition**: fixed (what changed), disputed (why the critic is wrong, with
  the file-and-number that proves it), or deferred (why it can wait). Commit it
  with the phase.
- **Clean** → no file. Add one line to the milestone's `notebook.md` (or
  `proposal_notebook.md` for the proposal):
  `Critical review: clean (data-integrity + interpretation)` or `(interpretation)`
  — so the clean verdict sits with the decide-gate checklist, not floating elsewhere.

**4. Act before presenting:**
- **Blocker** — must be resolved (fixed or disputed with a specific data
  citation, not "I'm confident") before the milestone closes.
- **Concern** — address or explicitly defer with a reason.
- **Note** — record; fix if cheap.
- **Push back when the critic is wrong.** It read the artifacts cold and may have
  missed context — but disputing requires a file-and-number, not confidence.

**5. Present to the researcher** alongside the decide-gate state: the
`critical_review.md` with your dispositions (or the one-line clean note).

## What the critic is told NOT to do

- **Not to review anything outside `{REVIEW_FOLDER}`.** Trusted inputs are read for
  evidence, never re-audited.
- **Not to redo the analysis.** It spot-checks the milestone's claims against the
  milestone's files; it does not re-run the method.
- **Not to manufacture findings.** Every finding cites a specific file, the
  literal column name, and the number. "Unverified — check X" beats a confident
  guess. A clean dimension is a valid verdict.
- **Not to rewrite anything.** It reports; the author dispositions.

## Red flags

**Never:**
- Skip the proposal review because "the plan is obvious," the analysis-milestone
  review because "the result is obvious," or a data-emitting methods review
  because "methods is only code."
- Close a milestone that grew after its critic pass without a delta pass over the
  new work.
- Start the Run phase, or close a milestone, with an unresolved Blocker.
- Re-audit an already-reviewed proposal or earlier milestone as part of a later
  milestone's review.
- Let the critic's confidence substitute for the data — a refutation without a
  file-and-number citation is itself a finding to dispute.
